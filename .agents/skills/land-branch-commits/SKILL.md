# Land Branch Commits

Use this when the user wants commits from one or more branches landed onto
`main`, but only if those commits would be new to `main`.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the current git state without changing it:
   ```bash
   git status --short --branch
   git remote -v
   ```
   Treat unrelated working tree changes as off-limits.

2. Fetch the exact refs you need:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main <branch1> <branch2> ...
   ```
   Prefer explicit branch names over a broad fetch.

3. Identify patch-new commits for each branch:
   ```bash
   git cherry -v origin/main origin/<branch>
   git log --graph --oneline --decorate --boundary origin/main..origin/<branch>
   ```
   Only commits marked `+` in `git cherry` are candidates.
   Commits marked `-` are already present on `main` by patch equivalence and must
   not be cherry-picked.

4. Cherry-pick onto local `main`:
   - Stay on `main`.
   - Preserve commit granularity: one original commit becomes one commit on
     `main`.
   - Preserve oldest-first order within each branch.
   - If multiple branches are independent, keep the user's branch order unless
     file overlap suggests a safer order.
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <oldest-sha> ... <newest-sha>
   ```

5. If a cherry-pick conflicts:
   - Resolve the conflict in the working tree.
   - Continue with `git cherry-pick --continue`.
   - If the commit becomes empty and the patch is already effectively present,
     skip it with `git cherry-pick --skip`.
   - Do not use `git merge`, `git stash`, or destructive reset commands.

6. Verify the result:
   ```bash
   git status --short --branch
   git log --oneline --reverse origin/main..main
   git cherry -v main origin/<branch>
   ```
   After success, each source branch should have no remaining `+` commits versus
   local `main`.

## Reporting

Report:
- Which branch refs were fetched
- Which commits were patch-new and selected
- Which new commit SHAs now exist on `main`
- Which commits were excluded because they were already on `main`
- Whether `main` is ahead of `origin/main`, and whether anything was pushed

## Notes

- Prefer `git cherry` over `git log main..branch` for this task. It filters out
  duplicate patches with different SHAs.
- Compare against `origin/main` to avoid reapplying commits already landed
  upstream.
- If local `main` does not match `origin/main`, call out the exact state before
  cherry-picking.
- Do not push unless the user asks.

## Arguments

- `$land-branch-commits branch-a branch-b` - land only the commits from those
  branches that are patch-new to `main`
