/// ## Known false positives (151 FP in corpus as of 2026-03-17)
///
/// An attempt was made to fix two issues (commit 38898a01, reverted f8166f95):
/// 1. Location mismatch: changed offense location from method name column to
///    block closing delimiter (end/}) to match RuboCop's range.
/// 2. Missing intermediate chain walk: added loop through receiver chain to
///    find multiline blocks through intermediate non-block calls.
///
/// Acceptance gate before: expected=3,616, actual=3,454, excess=0, missing=162
/// Acceptance gate after:  expected=3,616, actual=3,828, excess=212, missing=0
/// This swung from FN=162 to FP=212 — a net regression of 278 new excess.
///
/// Root cause of regression: the intermediate chain walk was too aggressive,
/// detecting chains that RuboCop doesn't flag. The location change alone might
/// be correct, but combined with the chain walk, it created new FPs.
///
/// A correct fix needs to:
/// 1. Separate the location fix from the chain walk fix
/// 2. Validate the location change independently against corpus
/// 3. Only add chain walk for patterns RuboCop actually flags (compare
///    RuboCop's on_block trigger more carefully)
