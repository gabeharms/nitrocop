/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-03)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=12,897, FN=23. Root cause: whitespace-only lines
/// (spaces/tabs) were treated as blank lines, but RuboCop's `EmptyLines` only
/// counts truly empty lines (zero bytes after newline removal). 91% of FPs came
/// from twilio-ruby's auto-generated code with indentation on blank lines.
/// Fix: changed `line.iter().all(|&b| b == b' ' || ...)` to `line.is_empty()`.
/// Acceptance gate after fix: expected=12,238, actual=13,320, excess=0, missing=0.
/// The 23 FNs are pre-existing (likely CodeMap edge cases) and unrelated.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-16)
///
/// FP=11 remained. All 11 FPs were consecutive blank lines at the very start of
/// a file (lines 1-2). Root cause: RuboCop's `each_extra_empty_line` starts with
/// `prev_line = 1` and uses `LINE_OFFSET = 2`, so the gap from virtual line 1 to
/// the first token must exceed 2 for any check to occur. This means 1-2 leading
/// blank lines are never flagged by Layout/EmptyLines (Layout/LeadingEmptyLines
/// handles those). nitrocop was using a flat `consecutive_blanks > max` threshold
/// everywhere, including at the file start.
/// Fix: track whether any non-blank line has been seen; before the first non-blank
/// line, use threshold `max + 1` instead of `max`, matching RuboCop's LINE_OFFSET
/// behavior.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-11)
///
/// FP=1,106 remained. Root cause: RuboCop uses token-based gap detection — it
/// collects line numbers that have tokens, then only checks gaps between
/// consecutive token-bearing lines. Comment-only files (no tokens) get early
/// return with no offenses. Blank lines after the last token line are never
/// checked. nitrocop was checking ALL blank lines (except inside non-code
/// ranges), which produced false positives on blank lines after the last code
/// line (common pattern: trailing comment sections after code).
/// Fix: use the Program node's end offset to find the last code line, and only
/// check blank lines within the code range. Comment-only files (empty Program
/// node where start == end) get early return.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-17)
///
/// FN=228 remained across 37 repos (127 from rubyworks/facets). Root cause:
/// RuboCop's `processed_source.tokens` includes `:tCOMMENT` tokens, so comment
/// lines are token-bearing. The previous fix used only `program_loc.end_offset()`
/// (last AST node line) as the cutoff, which missed blank lines between code
/// and trailing comments. For example, `end\n\n\n# comment` has blank lines
/// between the last code line and the comment line — RuboCop flags them because
/// the comment is a token line, but nitrocop skipped them.
/// Fix: compute `last_token_line` as `max(last_code_line, last_comment_line)`,
/// using `parse_result.comments()` to find comment lines. Comment-only files
/// now also get checked (they have comment tokens). The early return only triggers
/// when there are zero tokens of any kind (no code AND no comments).
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-17, FN=21 remaining)
///
/// ~16 FN inside `=begin`/`=end` blocks. Root cause: the cop used
/// `code_map.is_code(byte_offset)` to skip blank lines in non-code regions.
/// The CodeMap marks `=begin`/`=end` block comments as non-code (they are
/// comments), so blank lines inside them were skipped. But RuboCop's
/// `processed_source.tokens` includes `:tEMBDOC` tokens for `=begin`/`=end`
/// content lines, so consecutive blank lines inside them are still flagged.
/// Fix: switched from `is_code()` to `is_not_string()`, which skips
/// strings/heredocs/regexes/symbols but NOT comments (including `=begin`/`=end`).
/// This preserves heredoc/string skipping while allowing `=begin`/`=end`
/// blank line detection.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-17, FP=132)
///
/// 132 FPs from blank lines inside `=begin`/`=end` blocks. The previous fix
/// (switching to `is_not_string()`) was incorrect — RuboCop does NOT flag
/// consecutive blank lines inside `=begin`/`=end` blocks. Verified empirically:
/// a file with `=begin\n\n\n=end` produces 0 offenses from RuboCop.
/// Fix: track `=begin`/`=end` ranges during line iteration. When a line starts
/// with `=begin` (at column 0), enter embdoc mode. When a line starts with
/// `=end` (at column 0) while in embdoc mode, exit it. Skip all lines
/// (including blank lines) while in embdoc mode.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-17, FN=21 final fix)
///
/// 21 FN across 8 repos. Three root causes:
///
/// 1. **`=begin`/`=end` block skip was wrong** (~16 FN). RuboCop's
///    `processed_source.tokens` treats the entire `=begin`..`=end` block as a
///    single `tCOMMENT` token on line 1. The gap between that token line and
///    the next token after `=end` spans the block interior, so
///    `previous_and_current_lines_empty?` fires on consecutive blank lines
///    inside the block. The `in_embdoc` skip was based on an incorrect
///    empirical test. Fix: removed the `=begin`/`=end` skip entirely.
///
/// 2. **CRLF blank line handling** (~3 FN). Files with `\r\n` line endings
///    produced `b"\r"` lines after splitting on `\n`. `line.is_empty()` was
///    false for these, so blank CRLF lines were treated as non-blank. RuboCop
///    strips `\r` from lines. Fix: treat `b"\r"` as blank alongside empty.
///
/// 3. **Leading blank lines off-by-one** (~2 FN). The `max + 1` threshold at
///    file start caused the first offense to fire one line late. RuboCop's
///    `prev_line=1` + `LINE_OFFSET=2` approach means: if there are 3+ leading
///    blanks, fire starting at line 2 (where both line 1 and 2 are empty).
///    The consecutive_blanks counter at line 2 is 2, but `2 > max+1=2` is
///    false, so line 2 was missed. Fix: defer leading blank detection —
///    collect offsets during leading blanks, then emit retroactively when the
///    first non-blank line is seen, if there were 3+ leading blanks.
