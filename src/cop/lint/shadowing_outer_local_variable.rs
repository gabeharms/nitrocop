/// Checks for block parameters or block-local variables that shadow outer local variables.
///
/// ## Root causes of historical FP/FN (corpus conformance ~57%):
///
/// 1. **FP: Variable added to scope before RHS visited.** `visit_local_variable_write_node`
///    called `add_local` before visiting the value child. This caused `foo = bar { |foo| ... }`
///    to incorrectly flag `foo` as shadowing, because the LHS `foo` was already in scope when
///    the block was processed. RuboCop's VariableForce processes the RHS before declaring the
///    variable, so `foo` isn't in scope yet. Fix: visit the value first, then add to scope.
///
/// 2. **FN: Overly aggressive conditional suppression.** The `is_different_conditional_branch`
///    function had a `(None, Some(_)) => true` case that suppressed ALL shadowing when the
///    block was inside any conditional but the outer var was not. Per RuboCop, suppression
///    only applies when BOTH the outer var and the block are in different branches of the
///    SAME conditional node. Fix: remove the incorrect `(None, Some(_))` case.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-10)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=19, FN=51.
///
/// FP:
/// - Method parameters were predeclared before any default expression ran, so later
///   parameters leaked into earlier lambda defaults like
///   `outer: ->(cursor) { ... }, cursor: nil`.
/// - Class/module/singleton class bodies only pushed a nested scope, so top-level locals
///   leaked into class-body procs and lambdas.
///
/// FN:
/// - `params.posts()` and `params.keyword_rest()` were not checked or collected, so shadowing
///   was missed for post-splat params and `**kwargs`.
/// - Lambda/block body scopes also omitted some parameter kinds, so nested blocks could miss
///   outer block params.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-14)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=10, FN=42.
///
/// FP fixes applied:
/// - **Ractor.new block detection**: `is_ractor_new_call` detects `Ractor.new(...)` calls
///   and handles their blocks with an isolated scope (no shadowing check). RuboCop
///   explicitly skips Ractor blocks because Ractors cannot access outer scope, so
///   shadowing is intentional. Previously `is_ractor_new_block` was stubbed out.
///   Implementation uses `visit_call_node` override since Prism's BlockNode lacks
///   parent pointers.
/// - **When-condition assignment suppression**: Variables assigned in `when` conditions
///   (e.g., `when decl = env.fetch(...)`) are now marked with `when_condition_of_case`.
///   Blocks in the same `when` body that reuse the variable name are suppressed.
///   This matches RuboCop's `same_conditions_node_different_branch?` logic where both
///   the block and the outer variable resolve to the same conditional (case) node.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-17)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=4, FN=26.
///
/// FN fixes applied:
/// - **Predicate vs body distinction for adjacent-elsif suppression**: The
///   conditional_branch_stack now tracks an `is_body` flag. The adjacent-elsif
///   suppression only applies when the block is in a body, not in a condition
///   expression. Fixes `elsif entry = list.find { |entry| }` where block is in
///   the elsif condition (e.g., danbooru upload.rb lines 106/108).
///
/// Remaining FP (4): Thread.new(val) { |val| } suppression needs
/// `variable_used_in_declaration_of_outer?` which requires AST parent pointers.
/// opf/openproject and trogdoro/xiki FPs require VariableForce-level analysis.
///
/// Remaining FN (18): Most require `variable_used_in_declaration_of_outer?` or
/// deeper VariableForce tracking that nitrocop doesn't implement.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-03-18): FP=4→2, FN=19 unchanged
///
/// Fixed 2 of 4 FPs via two new suppression mechanisms:
///
/// 1. **Adjacent-elsif suppression extended to predicates**: Previously
///    Check 2 only fired when `block_is_in_body=true`. Changed to
///    `block_is_in_body || !outer_info.is_condition_var`, which allows
///    predicate blocks to be suppressed when the outer var was body-assigned.
///    Fixes FP in molybdenum-99/reality where `list` assigned in one elsif
///    body and block `{ |list| }` is in the next elsif's condition.
///
/// 2. **Same-conditional-node suppression (Check 3)**: When the outer var
///    was assigned in a conditional's predicate (`is_condition_var=true`)
///    and the block is in the same conditional's body, suppress. Matches
///    RuboCop's `variable_node == outer_local_variable_node` check. Fixes
///    FP in opf/openproject where `if item = page.menu_item` followed by
///    `item.tap { |item| }` in the then-body.
///
/// Remaining FP (2): opal/opal Thread.new(value) { |value| } and
/// trogdoro/xiki nested block shadowing require deeper analysis —
/// possibly VariableForce-level semantics or a corpus oracle anomaly.
///
/// Remaining FN (19): Require `variable_used_in_declaration_of_outer?`
/// or deeper VariableForce tracking that nitrocop doesn't implement.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-03-18): FP=2 unchanged, FN=19→8
///
/// Fixed 11 of 19 FNs via three changes:
///
/// 1. **Single-stmt-aware conditional suppression**: Refactored
///    `conditional_branch_stack` from tuples to `CondBranchEntry` structs
///    tracking `is_if_type` and `single_stmt` per branch. This allows
///    Check 1 (same-conditional different-branch) and Check 2 (adjacent
///    elsif) to correctly distinguish single-stmt vs multi-stmt branches.
///    For if/unless: always suppress (block.parent = if regardless of
///    statement count). For case/when: only suppress when block is in a
///    single-stmt when body (block.parent = when → case; multi-stmt →
///    begin ≠ case). For elsif Check 2: only suppress single-stmt bodies.
///    Fixes FNs in: ManageIQ, antiwork/gumroad, basecamp/kamal,
///    chrisseaton/rhizome (3), faye/faye-websocket, manyfold3d,
///    pickhardt/betty, sharetribe/sharetribe.
///
/// 2. **Splat rest param in destructured block params**: Added
///    `rest()` node check in `check_multi_target_shadow` — splat params
///    inside `|(car, *fruits)|` were not being checked for shadowing.
///
/// 3. **BlockContext refactor**: Bundled block context params into
///    `BlockContext` struct for cleaner parameter threading.
///
/// Remaining FP (2): unchanged (opal Thread.new, xiki nested block).
/// Remaining FN (8): Shopify/tapioca, holman/boom (2),
/// interagent/prmd, soutaro/steep (2), sup-heliotrope/sup,
/// troessner/reek — these require deeper VariableForce semantics.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-03-18): FP=2 unchanged, FN=8→3
///
/// Fixed 5 of 8 FNs via two changes:
///
/// 1. **When-condition predicate context**: Added a `CondBranchEntry`
///    with `is_body: false` and `single_stmt: false` when visiting
///    when conditions in `visit_when_node_with_case_offset`. Previously,
///    blocks inside when conditions inherited the when body's
///    `single_stmt` flag, causing Check 1 to incorrectly suppress
///    shadowing between different when clauses. The new entry ensures
///    blocks in when conditions don't benefit from single-stmt
///    suppression. Fixes steep FN: `when decl = find {|decl|}` in
///    second when clause now correctly flags shadowing.
///
/// 2. **Check 3 branch constraint**: Tightened the same-conditional-node
///    suppression (Check 3) to require matching branch_offset, not just
///    cond_offset. Previously, variables assigned in one when's condition
///    would suppress blocks in any other when's condition because both
///    shared the case's cond_offset. Now Check 3 only suppresses when
///    the block is in the SAME branch as the outer variable (e.g.,
///    `if item = get_item; item.tap { |item| }` in the then-body).
///
/// Remaining FP (2): unchanged (opal Thread.new, xiki nested block —
/// both likely VariableForce-level semantics or corpus oracle anomalies).
/// Remaining FN (3): holman/boom (2) are NOT real FNs — the block is
/// inside the outer variable's assignment RHS, suppressed by both
/// RuboCop's `variable_used_in_declaration_of_outer?` and nitrocop's
/// visit-RHS-first ordering. interagent/prmd FN requires detecting
/// that a block nested in a method chain (`.map {}.reduce()`) should
/// not be suppressed by Check 2 — would need parent-pointer tracking.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-03-20): FP=2→0, FN=3→0 (target)
///
/// Fixed 2 FPs and remaining FNs via four changes:
///
/// 1. **Thread.new argument suppression**: Collects local variable names
///    from call arguments into `call_arg_var_names`. Block params matching
///    these names are suppressed (e.g., `Thread.new(value) { |value| }`).
///    Also handles splat args (`Thread.new(*args) { |*args| }`).
///    Fixes opal/opal FP.
///
/// 2. **Unless branch reordering**: `visit_unless_node` now visits the
///    else clause BEFORE the unless body, matching Parser gem's AST
///    representation where `unless` is `if` with swapped branches.
///    This ensures variables from the else body are in scope when
///    blocks in the unless body are processed. Fixes holman/boom FN
///    and similar patterns where block in unless body shadows var
///    from else body.
///
/// 3. **Method chain expression depth**: `visit_call_node` now increments
///    `expression_depth` when visiting the receiver of a call. Blocks
///    inside a method chain receiver (e.g., `x.map { |v| }.reduce()`)
///    correctly get `is_nested_in_expression = true`, preventing
///    incorrect conditional branch suppression. Fixes interagent/prmd FN.
///
/// 4. **Various FN fixes**: Multiple patterns involving variables in
///    non-adjacent elsif branches, while-loop variables, multi-assign
///    LHS variables, catch/else scoping, and case/when condition
///    assignments now correctly detect shadowing. Added 20+ test cases.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-03-23): FP=3→0, FN=113→? (estimated ~30)
///
/// Two changes:
///
/// 1. **Removed `call_arg_var_names` mechanism**: This suppressed shadowing
///    when a call argument name matched a block parameter name (e.g.,
///    `Thread.new(value) { |value| }`). But RuboCop only special-cases
///    Ractor.new (already handled separately), NOT Thread.new or any
///    other call. The mechanism was causing ~80+ FNs across the corpus
///    (Thread.new, reduce, File.open, Dir.chdir, inject, etc.).
///
/// 2. **Inherited conditional context for nested blocks**: Added
///    `inherited_cond_branch` to propagate conditional context through
///    block boundaries. When a block inside an if-branch contains an
///    inner block, the inner block can now detect that the outer variable
///    is in a different branch of the same if. This matches RuboCop's
///    `same_conditions_node_different_branch?` which walks up the AST
///    through block parent pointers to find conditional ancestors.
///    Fixes FPs in active-hash (pluck pattern), neo4j/activegraph,
///    and trogdoro/xiki where nested blocks in else-branches were
///    incorrectly flagged.
///
/// Also corrected the `get_login_info` test case from offense to
/// no_offense — RuboCop's `variable_node` for a deeply nested block
/// returns the parent of the innermost scope, which traverses through
/// block boundaries. When the enclosing block IS the else_branch of
/// the if, `variable_node == if.else_branch` is true, so RuboCop
/// suppresses (not an offense).
