# Investigation: target_dir relativization for cop Include patterns

**Status:** Reverted (commit 93d80fad reverts a81e1179)
**Date:** 2026-03-26

## Problem

When nitrocop runs via the corpus runner with an overlay config from a temp
directory, cop-level Include patterns fail to match files. This causes systemic
FN across cops that use Include patterns (most Rails/*, some RSpec/*).

The corpus runner invokes:
```
nitrocop --config /tmp/nitrocop_corpus_configs/overlay.yml /path/to/repo
# with cwd=/tmp
```

This sets:
- `config_dir` = `/tmp/nitrocop_corpus_configs/` (config file's parent)
- `base_dir` = `/tmp` (CWD, because config filename isn't `.rubocop*`)
- File paths are absolute: `/path/to/repo/app/controllers/foo.rb`

In `is_cop_match()` (src/config/mod.rs:294-343), file paths are relativized
against `config_dir` and `base_dir` via `strip_prefix`. Both fail because the
file isn't under either directory. Include patterns like `**/*.rb` compiled with
`literal_separator(true)` don't match the raw absolute path either.

Result: every cop with Include patterns is silently skipped for all files.

Multiple agent investigations independently discovered this as the root cause
of their FN: Rails/Delegate (#202), Rails/EnvironmentVariableAccess (#216),
Security/Open (#228).

## What Was Tried

Added `target_dir` (the CLI positional argument, e.g., `/path/to/repo`) as a
fifth relativization attempt in `is_cop_match()`, `is_cop_excluded()`, and
`is_path_matched_by_cop_config()`. For `/path/to/repo/lib/foo.rb` with
`target_dir=/path/to/repo`, `strip_prefix` produces `lib/foo.rb` — which
matches Include patterns.

Changes (all in `src/config/mod.rs`, now reverted):
- Added `target_dir: Option<PathBuf>` to `ResolvedConfig` and `CopFilterSet`
- Populated from `load_config()`'s existing `target_dir` parameter
- Added `rel_to_target` to Include/Exclude checks in three functions
- 3 new unit tests, all 4,388 existing tests passed
- Validated with `check_cop.py --rerun --clone --sample 30` for Rails/Delegate
  and Rails/EnvironmentVariableAccess — both showed 0 new FP / 0 new FN

## What Went Wrong

The fix caused a massive FP regression in the full corpus oracle run:

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Conformance | 98.5% | 97.2% |
| FP total | 39,063 | 57,988 |
| FN total | 411,172 | 770,784 |
| Rails FP | 92 | 19,071 |
| 100% match repos | 441 | 266 |

Cops that were previously silently disabled (0 matches, 0 FP, 0 FN) started
running and produced thousands of FP:

| Cop | New FP | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Rails/ThreeStateBooleanColumn | 6,988 | Migration-only cop |
| Rails/ReversibleMigration | 4,589 | Migration-only cop |
| Rails/CreateTableWithTimestamps | 3,507 | Migration-only cop |
| Rails/Output | 1,425 | |
| Rails/ReversibleMigrationMethodDefinition | 829 | Migration-only cop |
| Rails/I18nLocaleAssignment | 783 | |
| Rails/NotNullColumn | 287 | Migration-only cop |
| Rails/TimeZoneAssignment | 277 | |
| Rails/AddColumnIndex | 205 | Migration-only cop |
| Rails/DangerousColumnNames | 171 | Migration-only cop |

## Why the Pre-merge Validation Missed This

`check_cop.py --rerun --clone --sample 30` was run for two cops and showed
"0 new FP / 0 new FN". This check compares per-repo counts against the old
oracle baseline. For cops with 0 baseline matches (like ThreeStateBooleanColumn),
adding thousands of FP shows as "0 new FP" because the baseline has no per-repo
data to compare against. The check declared victory; a full oracle run was needed
to catch the regression.

## Underlying Issues (not yet resolved)

The `target_dir` relativization made Include patterns match correctly, which
exposed a deeper problem: nitrocop runs cops that RuboCop wouldn't, because
other gating mechanisms differ between them:

1. **Corpus config resolution mismatch**: The corpus runner uses a shared
   `baseline_rubocop.yml` that enables all cops. RuboCop's own per-repo config
   resolution may disable cops via the project's `.rubocop.yml`, `inherit_from`,
   or gem-level config that the overlay doesn't replicate.

2. **Migration cops gating**: Cops like `Rails/ReversibleMigration` are meant to
   only run on migration files. RuboCop may skip them via `MigratedSchemaVersion`
   or other project-specific config that the corpus baseline doesn't set per-repo.

3. **Corpus runner CWD**: `run_nitrocop.py` uses `cwd=/tmp` to "avoid .gitignore
   interference." This is what makes `base_dir` resolve to `/tmp` instead of the
   repo root. Changing CWD to the repo dir might fix the relativization without
   needing `target_dir`, but the .gitignore concern hasn't been investigated.

## Possible Directions

These are starting points, not prescriptions — the right fix may be something
different entirely.

- **Fix the corpus runner instead of nitrocop**: Change `run_nitrocop.py` to
  set `cwd` to the repo directory instead of `/tmp`. This would make `base_dir`
  resolve to the repo root naturally, without adding `target_dir` to the core.
  The `/tmp` CWD was chosen to "avoid .gitignore interference" but that concern
  may no longer apply.

- **Narrow the target_dir fix**: Instead of enabling it for all cops, only use
  `target_dir` relativization when the cop already has non-zero baseline matches
  in the oracle. This prevents silent cops from suddenly firing while fixing FN
  for cops that should have been matching.

- **Investigate why those cops produce FP**: The migration-only cops
  (ThreeStateBooleanColumn, ReversibleMigration, etc.) produced thousands of FP.
  Understanding why RuboCop doesn't fire them (MigratedSchemaVersion? project
  config? gem version gating?) would clarify whether the fix needs a guard or
  whether those cops have a separate implementation gap.

- **Different config approach for corpus**: Rather than a temp overlay config,
  the corpus runner could write a `.rubocop.yml` inside the repo directory
  itself (cleaning up after). This would make `config_dir` resolve to the repo
  root, sidestepping the relativization issue entirely.

## Investigation Session 2 (2026-03-26)

### Key Discovery: RuboCop has the same bug (symmetric failure)

The FP regression was NOT caused by migration cops having bad implementations.
It was caused by an **asymmetric fix**: the target_dir change only fixed
nitrocop, but the oracle's RuboCop invocation has the identical Include matching
failure.

In the corpus oracle workflow (`.github/workflows/corpus-oracle.yml:284-298`):
```
bundle exec rubocop --config "$REPO_CONFIG" ... "$ABS_DEST"
```

- `$REPO_CONFIG` is either `bench/corpus/baseline_rubocop.yml` or
  `/tmp/nitrocop_corpus_configs/corpus_config_xxx.yml`
- Neither starts with `.rubocop`, so RuboCop's `base_dir = Dir.pwd` = CI workspace
- For `repos/REPO_ID/db/migrate/xxx.rb`, RuboCop relativizes to
  `repos/REPO_ID/db/migrate/xxx.rb` (includes `repos/` prefix)
- Include pattern `db/**/*.rb` does NOT match `repos/REPO_ID/db/migrate/xxx.rb`

Both tools are symmetrically broken — 0 offenses for Include-gated cops. The
target_dir fix broke this symmetry: nitrocop found thousands of offenses that
RuboCop couldn't, all counted as FP.

### CWD does not affect file discovery

Confirmed that `WalkBuilder::new(dir)` in `src/fs.rs` walks from the target
directory, not CWD. The `.gitignore` concern in `run_nitrocop.py`'s `/tmp` CWD
is about config resolution (`base_dir`), not file discovery. Changing CWD to
the repo dir would fix `base_dir` for nitrocop but NOT for RuboCop in the oracle
(which has its own CWD).

### Recommended fix: in-repo config with `.rubocop*` name

Both tools have identical `base_dir` logic: if config filename starts with
`.rubocop`, then `base_dir = dirname(config_path)`. By writing the overlay as
`<repo_dir>/.rubocop_corpus.yml`:

1. `base_dir = repo_dir` for **both** tools
2. `strip_prefix(repo_dir)` succeeds for all repo files
3. Include patterns match correctly in both tools
4. No Rust code changes needed — fix is entirely in Python/CI layer
5. FP/FN delta reflects real implementation gaps, not config artifacts

### Oracle run #162 produced 0% conformance (pre-existing workflow bug)

The first oracle run after the config fix (run #162, PR #230) showed 0%
conformance with all 5,590 repos erroring: "No rubocop JSON output file".

Root cause: commit 8774941b ("Free disk in corpus collect-results") added
`rm -rf all-results/results/rubocop` BEFORE the diff step that reads from
`--rubocop-dir all-results/results/rubocop`. This pre-existing bug was masked
because the previous oracle run (#161) happened to run before that commit
landed. Fix: moved the cleanup to after the diff step.

### Oracle run #163 (PR #231): 94.1% conformance, down from 98.5%

After fixing the `rm -rf` bug (run #162 was 0% due to deleted rubocop results),
run #163 produced real data. Key numbers:

| Metric | Old | New | Delta |
|--------|-----|-----|-------|
| Match rate | 98.5% | 94.1% | -4.4% |
| Matches | 29,571,533 | 28,313,268 | -1,258,265 |
| FP | 39,063 | 40,168 | +1,105 |
| FN | 411,172 | 1,707,967 | +1,296,795 |
| 100% repos | 441 | 224 | -217 |
| Exact cops | 371 | 110 | -261 |

Department breakdown (FN changes):
- Style: 215,547 → 1,031,471 (+815,924)
- Layout: 173,726 → 408,407 (+234,681)
- Lint: 16,151 → 168,323 (+152,172)
- Metrics: 3,270 → 31,105 (+27,835)
- RSpec: 333 → 20,215 (+19,882)
- Naming: 1,221 → 19,830 (+18,609)
- Rails: 444 → 16,301 (+15,857, FP: 92 → 7,661)
- Performance: 416 → 6,679 (+6,263)
- Gemspec: 0 → 3,901
- Bundler: 0 → 743

FP is mostly flat (+1,105 overall), confirming both tools are symmetrically
fixed. But Rails FP jumped +7,569 (expected — migration cops now fire).

The massive FN increase affects ALL departments, including cops WITHOUT Include
patterns (Layout, Style, Lint, Metrics, Naming). This means the `base_dir`
change affects more than just cop-level Include patterns — it changes how
AllCops.Exclude and cop-level Exclude patterns resolve too. Under investigation.

### Key finding: RuboCop ignores cop Exclude patterns regardless of base_dir

Tested on dotenv: RuboCop produces identical offenses (2267) with either
config (baseline OR overlay). Its `base_dir_for_path_parameters` changes
(`/workspace` → `/tmp/dotenv_test`), but cop-level Exclude patterns like
`spec/**/*` on `Style/DocumentationMethod` have NO effect on RuboCop's output.

Meanwhile, nitrocop's offense count drops (2258 → 2244) with the overlay
because its `is_cop_match()` now correctly applies Exclude patterns.

This means:
- OLD oracle (baseline config): Both tools broken on patterns → both run cops
  on all files → offenses match → **inflated conformance**
- NEW oracle (overlay config): Only nitrocop fixed → it correctly excludes
  spec/test files → RuboCop still reports them → **asymmetric = FN increase**

The "symmetric fix" hypothesis was wrong. RuboCop's cop-level Include/Exclude
resolution works differently than nitrocop's — it doesn't use
`base_dir_for_path_parameters` for cop Exclude patterns.

### Resolution: reverted in-repo overlay config (2026-03-26)

Reverted the `.rubocop_corpus.yml` overlay approach. The config change only
fixed nitrocop's pattern resolution while RuboCop's was unaffected, creating
an asymmetry that dropped conformance from 98.5% to 94.1%. The 98.5% was
correct from the "does nitrocop match RuboCop" perspective — both tools ran
all cops on all files, and results mostly agreed.

The 47 Include-gated cops with no corpus data remain unfixed. A correct fix
would need to either:
- Make nitrocop match RuboCop's (lenient) cop Include/Exclude behavior
- Fix both tools simultaneously (requires changes to RuboCop itself)
- Accept per-cop FN for correctly-scoped cops and fix implementations
